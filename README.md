# siem-detection-gap-analysis
SIEM Detection Gap Analysis is a cybersecurity research and lab project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of security monitoring and detection systems. The project simulates real-world cyberattacks by exploiting vulnerable services in a controlled environment using Kali Linux and Metasploit. It then compares raw system logs with SIEM-generated alerts (Splunk/ELK) to analyze detection coverage and identify monitoring gaps.

The project demonstrates how attacks may occur without proper detection and provides insights into improving threat visibility, log management, and security monitoring strategies. It reflects both offensive (penetration testing) and defensive (security monitoring) cybersecurity practices.
